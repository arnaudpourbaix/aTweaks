THAC0:
Note: based on Table 39 of the 2E AD&D DMG. 
Creatures that do not have character classes and levels calculate THAC0s differently, basing it on the Hit Dice of the creature. 
When a creature has three or more points added to its Hit Dice, count another dice when consulting the table (i.e 8+3 HD = THAC0 11).
Note: creature THAC0 values above 16 HD are not present in PnP. They are based on the established progression rate. 
Also, according to High Level Campaigns, creatures have no THAC0 limits so they could theoretically get negative THAC0 values above 20 HD.

Weapon Enchantment:
Based on Table 48 of the 2E AD&D DMG. Should be used as a guideline but can be adjusted for balance purposes. 
Specifically, the attacks of clearly magical creatures (i.e. mephits) should at least count as +1 weapons.

Creature Hit Dice  Weapon Enchantment
4+1                     +1
6+2                     +2
8+3                     +3
10+4                    +4


Weapon Reach:
According to the AD&D Combat and Tactics supplement, weapon reach should generally be based on creature size. Of course, this can be adjusted for balance purposes and due to animation issues.
Note: creatures of L size or larger should probably have bump = 1

Size           Weapon Reach
Tiny       (T)      0
Small      (S)      1
Man-sized  (M)      1
Large      (L)      2
Huge       (H)      2
Gargantuan (G)      3
